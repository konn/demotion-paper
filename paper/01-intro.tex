\section{Introduction}
Since Haskell had been given a Promotion~\cite{Yorgey:2012}, using Haskell with dependent types is a joy.
It's not only a joy: it gives us a neat language to express invariants of program with type-level constraints.

Brouwer--Heyting--Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation of intuitionistic logic: proofs of some proposition are identified with witnessing ``functions''.
For example, proof of $P \land Q$ is given by the pair of proofs $\tau: P$ and $\upsilon: Q$; $P \to Q$ is given by a function taking a proof of $P$ and returns $Q$, ---and so on.
This conception of intuitionistic logic is later made precise as Curry-Howard correspondance and Kleene's Realaisability Model.
